# 📁 scratch-image-uploader
a chrome(ium) extension which allows image uploading directly through scratch 
## 💾 Installation
[get it from the chrome webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/scratch-image-uploader/ofjfkbdgogigeclofnlgpbimaaohkjoo) or [install it using chrome's built in development mode for extensions](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted)
## 📝 TODO
- fix on firefox

- switch to using assets instead of project thumbnails (needs discussion)

- add a menu for changing an image after it's been done. (needs design)

- add user feedback when using drag and drop

- i dont know if this is possible or not, but perhaps when adding the file upload button in, it could be done in a way that it looks like it all loads at the same time?
